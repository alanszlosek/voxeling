# Player Position ADR

## Template

In the context of <use case/user story u>,
facing <concern c>

we decided for <option o> and neglected <other options>,
to achieve <system qualities/desired consequences>,
accepting <downside d/undesired consequences>,
because <additional rationale>.

## Actual

In the context of the player's position and how other modules reference it,
facing the difficulty of refactoring the player object and its internals,

we decided for the Observer pattern
and against passing a handle to the player into object constructors or the current approach of finding the player object through the game global variable,

to achieve decoupling,

accepting that many files need to be touched and that I may have to refactor their logic to be event-driven.
